# MoveIt Extension

This extension integrates the core stack of [MoveIt 2](https://github.com/moveit/moveit2) to the AICA System, enabling
the use of advanced motion planning and manipulation capabilities. Hardware-specific assets are not provided by this
extension and have to be developed on top (for example, through the
[MoveIt Setup Assistant](https://moveit.picknik.ai/main/doc/examples/setup_assistant/setup_assistant_tutorial.html)).

To use this in your AICA System configuration, add the following custom extension:

```
@aica/foss/moveit:v0.1.0
```
