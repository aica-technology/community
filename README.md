This is the home of the AICA Community Feedback & Public Roadmap.

## Welcome to AICA's Public Roadmap! ðŸš€

This roadmap is a transparent view of the features and improvements weâ€™re planning and a space for you to provide feedback and share your own ideas. We aim to keep our community informed, engaged, and involved in shaping the direction of the AICA System!

**What you'll find here:**
You will find all feature requests as well as internal quarterly initiatives in the [Feedback & Initiative tracker](https://github.com/orgs/aica-technology/projects/4/views/8)

- "To be Reviewed" or "Validating" features: Potential future ideas and features- requested by both the AICA team and users, which have not been reviewed or have not been committed to yet.
- "Planned" features tied to versions: What weâ€™ve committed to internally along with their planned version.
- "Unplanned" features: Feature requests that will not make it on the roadmap for now- unfortunately we are not able to squeeze everything in!

For the roadmap view, please refer to the [Planned Feedback Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/aica-technology/projects/4/views/4) and the [Planned Initiative Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/aica-technology/projects/4/views/10).

**Weâ€™d love your feedback! Hereâ€™s how you can contribute:**

- React: Use GitHub reactions to upvote feedback/features that excite you.
- Comment: Share your thoughts, suggestions, or use cases in the comments under specific feedback/features.
- Submit Ideas: Have an idea that's not listed? Submit a feature request using our [issue form](https://github.com/aica-technology/community/issues/new/choose).

**How we use this roadmap:**
This roadmap is a living document. While we aim to stick to our plans, timelines and priorities may shift. We will do our best to move features to the appropriate version accordingly.
